## Introduction

`ElegantPages` comes with 2 types of components, [`ElegantPagesView`](https://github.com/ThasianX/ElegantPages/blob/master/Sources/ElegantPages/Pages/Internal/ElegantPagesView.swift) and [`ElegantListView`](https://github.com/ThasianX/ElegantPages/blob/master/Sources/ElegantPages/Lists/Internal/ElegantListView.swift). 

For simpler usage, `ElegantPagesView` is recommended as it loads all page views immediately.

For more complex usage, `ElegantListView` is recommended as it loads page views on demand([learn more](#how-it-works)).

The elegance of both these views is that they work as a paging component should be intended to work. One bug that is often seen in SwiftUI is that `ScrollView`, `List`, or any `Gesture` almost certainly interferes with other gestures in the view. However, `ElegantPages` fixes this issue and scrolling through a paging component even with embedded `Gestures` works elegantly.

## Basic usage

The `ElegantPagesView` component is available through [`ElegantHPages`](https://github.com/ThasianX/ElegantPages/blob/master/Sources/ElegantPages/Pages/Public/ElegantHPages.swift) and [`ElegantVPages`](https://github.com/ThasianX/ElegantPages/blob/master/Sources/ElegantPages/Pages/Public/ElegantVPages.swift).

```swift

import ElegantPages

struct ElegantVPagesExample: View {

    let manager = ElegantPagesManager(startingPage: 1, pageTurnType: .earlyCutOffDefault)

    var body: some View {
        ElegantVPages(manager: manager) {
            CustomButtonView()
            CustomView()
            CustomListView()
        }
    }

}
```

The `ElegantListView` component is available through [`ElegantHList`](https://github.com/ThasianX/ElegantPages/blob/master/Sources/ElegantPages/Lists/Public/ElegantHList.swift) and [`ElegantVList`](https://github.com/ThasianX/ElegantPages/blob/master/Sources/ElegantPages/Lists/Public/ElegantVList.swift).

```swift

import ElegantPages

let listData = (1...40).map { _ in "Ideally, this should be more dynamic content to make the most use out of this list" }

struct ElegantVListExample: View {

    let manager = ElegantListManager(pageCount: vListData.count, pageTurnType: .earlyCutOffDefault)
    
    var body: some View {
        ElegantVList(manager: manager,
                     pageTurnType: .earlyCutOffDefault) { page in 
            ExampleView(page: page).erased
        }
    }

}

struct ExampleView: View {

    let page: Int

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Page \(page)")
                .font(.largeTitle)
            Text(listData[page])
                .font(.title)
        }
        .padding()
    }
    
}

```

## How it works

`ElegantPagesView` is pretty simple. It uses a [function builder](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/9992cf3c11c2d5e0ea20bee98657d93902d5b174/proposals/XXXX-function-builders.md) to gather the page views and puts them in either a `HStack` or `VStack` depending on the type of `ElegantPages` view chosen. As a result, all views are created immediately. 

`ElegantListView` is quite interesting. For more flexibility, it uses a `@ViewBuilder` to get the view for any given page(it's the closure at the end of the `ElegantVList` declaration. When it is first initialized, it calls this closure at most 3 times, to get the views for the starting pages. These views are used to initialize an array of at most 3 `UIHostingControllers`, whose `rootViews` are set to a specific origin in a `UIViewController`. Here's the catch, at any given moment, there are at most only 3 pages loaded. As the user scrolls to the next page, old pages are removed and new pages are inserted; the views themselves are juggled as their origins are changed per page turn. This keeps overall memory usage down and also makes scrolling blazingly fast. If you're curious, take a [peek](https://github.com/ThasianX/ElegantPages/blob/master/Sources/ElegantPages/Lists/Internal/ElegantListController.swift).

## Customization

The following aspects of any `ElegantPages` component can be customized:

#### `pageTurnType`: Whether to scroll to the next page early or until the user lets go of the drag

```swift 

public enum PageTurnType {

    case regular(pageTurnDelta: CGFloat)
    case earlyCutoff(config: EarlyCutOffConfiguration)

}

public struct EarlyCutOffConfiguration {

    public let scrollResistanceCutOff: CGFloat
    public let pageTurnCutOff: CGFloat
    public let pageTurnAnimation: Animation
    
}

```

A regular page turn only turns the page after the user ends their drag. 

- The `pageTurnDelta` represents the percentage of how far across the screen the user has to drag in order for the page to turn when they let go. The default value for this is 0.3, as part of an extension of `PageTurnType`. 
- The default regular page turn can be accessed through `PageTurnType.regularDefault`

An early cutoff page turn turns the page when the user drags a certain distance across the screen.

- `scrollResistanceCutOff`: The distance that the view is offset as the user drags.
- `pageTurnCutOff`: The distance across the screen the user has to drag before the page is turned(once this value is reached, the page automatically gets turned to and the user's ongoing gesture is invalidated). 
- `pageTurnAnimation`: The animation used when the page is turned
- The default early cut off page turn can be accessed through `PageTurnType.earlyCutOffDefault`

In case `scrollResistanceCutOff` isn't clear, here's an example. Say we have a horizontally draggable view. If you drag 80 pixels to the right, the offset that is visible to you is also 80 pixels. The amount you scroll is equal to the visible offset. However, if you have a scroll resistance of say 40 pixels, after dragging 80 pixels to the right, you only see that the view has moved 40 pixels to the right. That is why it is called resistance.

###$ `viewForPage`: datasource method called whenever a new page is displayed that asks for the view of the new page. Available only for `ElegantList` components

```swift 

// Use as a function
ElegantVList(..., viewForPage: exampleView)

func exampleView(for page: Int) -> AnyView { ExampleView(...) }

// Use as a closure
ElegantHList(...) { page in ExampleView(...) }
    
```

#### `onPageChanged`: called whenever a new page is shown. Available for all `ElegantPages` components.

```swift 

ElegantVList(...)
    .onPageChanged(...)

ElegantHList(...)
    .onPageChanged(...)
    
ElegantHPages(...)
    .onPageChanged(...)
    
ElegantVPages(...)
    .onPageChanged(...)
    
```

#### `frame`: used to set a custom height or width for `ElegantList` components

```swift 

// You may want a smaller width for the VList. However, height for the VList will always be the screen height
ElegantVList(...)
    .frame(width: ...)

// You may want a smaller height for the HList. However, width for the HList will always be the screen width
ElegantHList(...)
    .frame(height: ...)
    
```
